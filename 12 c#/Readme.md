## SOLID Principle
> S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have one, and only one, reason to exists or change.
> O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification.
> L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Every child class or derived class should be replaceable with their parent or base class without causing issues
> I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Interface should have one responsibility. Better to have several specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface.
> D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Write code that depends upon abstractions rather than upon concrete details. â€œHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
