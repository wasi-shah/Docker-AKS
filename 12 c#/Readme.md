## SOLID Principle
1. **S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have one, and only one, reason to exists or change.
2. **O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Every child class or derived class should be replaceable with their parent or base class without causing issues
4. **I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Interface should have one responsibility. Better to have several specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface.
5. **D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Write code that depends upon abstractions rather than upon concrete details. “High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
